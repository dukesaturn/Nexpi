# Contributing to Nexpi
Welcome Contributors!

Thank you for considering contributing to Nexpi! This repository houses a collection of reusable components and modules designed for Next.js 14 applications. Whether you're interested in improving existing components, adding new ones, or contributing CSS module packages, your contributions are highly valued.
How Can You Contribute?

    Improving Existing Components:
        Feel free to review the existing components and submit enhancements, bug fixes, or optimizations. Ensure to follow our coding standards and best practices.

    Creating New Components:
        If you have a new idea for a component that could benefit the community, propose your concept in an issue first. Once approved, you can proceed with implementing and submitting a pull request.

    Adding CSS Module Packages:
        Since our package is compiled with tsc, CSS module files (.css) must be manually managed. You can contribute by creating new CSS modules that align with our design system and component library guidelines.
